# Operating-System
Building the architecture and simulating a real operating system using Java.


Created an interpreter that reads programs in the form of txt files and executes their code. Implemented a
memory and saved the processes in it, mutexes that ensure mutual exclusion over the critical resources, and a scheduler that schedules the
processes that we have in our system.
